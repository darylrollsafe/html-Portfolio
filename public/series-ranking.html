<h1>The Best Series According To Daryl</h1>
<br>
<h2>My top 3 series of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Breaking Bad</h3>
<p>Breaking Bad is my all time favorite because of Walter White's Character development,<br>
    i have never seen anything like it.</p>
    <br>

<h3>Peaky Blinders</h3>
 <p>The great Thomas Shelby made that a memorable one for me,<br>
        another great character development in that series
    </p>
<br>

<h3>Power</h3>
<p>"This is a big rich town" those are the opening lyrics to the theme song.<br>
It always gave me goosebumps.<br>
Really great show.</p>
